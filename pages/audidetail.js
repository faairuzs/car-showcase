              Audi, is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles
              headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. As a subsidiary of
              its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles
              in nine production facilities worldwide. The origins of the
              company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the
              initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer
              August Horch (1868â€“1951); and two other manufacturers (DKW and
              Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The
              modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired
              by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi
              brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series,
              Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus
              creating the present-day form of the company.
